# flask_task
I built a web app using Flask and MySQL. It includes user authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts, and pagination API. Flask-Login was used for authentication, SQLAlchemy for blog post functionality, and Flask-Paginate for pagination.

Here are the features of the web application you developed:

-User authentication (registration, login, and logout)
-CRUD operations for blog posts
-Displaying a list of all posts on the homepage
-Displaying a single post on a separate page
-Including a pagination API for displaying multiple blog posts
